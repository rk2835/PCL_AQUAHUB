# Auto-Fill Address Feature Documentation

## Overview
The manual address form now automatically fills with location data when customers use Google Maps location detection, making the booking process faster and more accurate while still allowing full customization.

## How It Works

### 1. Trigger Methods
The address form auto-fills when customers:
- ‚úÖ Click "Use Current Location" button
- ‚úÖ Search and select a location from Google Maps autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Any successful location detection via Google Maps API

### 2. Auto-Fill Process

#### Step 1: Location Detection
When a location is detected (via current location or search):
```javascript
// Location data is captured with full address components
selectedLocation = {
    address: "Full formatted address",
    lat: latitude,
    lng: longitude,
    name: "Location name",
    addressDetails: {
        house_number: "123",
        road: "MG Road",
        suburb: "Koramangala",
        city: "Bangalore",
        state: "Karnataka",
        postcode: "560001"
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Manual Form Auto-Display
- The manual address form automatically expands if hidden
- The toggle button updates to show "Close Manual Entry"

#### Step 3: Field Population
Each field is filled with corresponding data:

| Form Field | Data Source | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| House/Flat/Building No. | `house_number` | "123" |
| Street/Road Name | `road` or `street` | "MG Road" |
| Area/Locality | `suburb`, `neighbourhood`, or `quarter` | "Koramangala" |
| City | `city`, `town`, or `village` | "Bangalore" |
| State | `state` (auto-matched from dropdown) | "Karnataka" |
| Pincode | `postcode` | "560001" |

#### Step 4: Visual Feedback
- Each filled field gets highlighted with green background
- Green border indicates the field was auto-filled
- Highlight animation lasts 2 seconds
- Success notification appears: "‚úÖ Address form auto-filled! Please review and modify if needed."

#### Step 5: Form Scroll
- Page automatically scrolls to the address form
- Smooth scroll animation for better UX
- Form positioned in center of viewport

### 3. Customer Can Modify
**All fields remain fully editable** after auto-fill:
- Click any field to edit
- Type new information
- Clear and re-enter data
- Change state from dropdown
- Update pincode (triggers pincode lookup)

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added

#### 1. `fillManualAddressFromLocation(addressData)`
Main function that populates the form:
```javascript
function fillManualAddressFromLocation(addressData) {
    // Shows manual form if hidden
    // Extracts address components
    // Fills each field
    // Highlights fields
    // Shows notification
    // Scrolls to form
}
```

#### 2. `highlightField(fieldId)`
Visual feedback for auto-filled fields:
```javascript
function highlightField(fieldId) {
    // Green background (#d4edda)
    // Green border (#28a745)
    // Smooth transition (0.3s)
    // Auto-removes after 2s
}
```

### Modified Functions

#### 1. `onPlaceChanged()`
Enhanced to extract and use address components:
- Parses Google Places API response
- Extracts all address components
- Maps components to form fields
- Calls `fillManualAddressFromLocation()`

#### 2. `getCurrentLocation()`
Updated to auto-fill after detecting location:
- Stores `addressDetails` in `selectedLocation`
- Calls `fillManualAddressFromLocation()`
- Enhanced success message

#### 3. `useCoordinatesOnly()`
Fallback geocoding also auto-fills:
- Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim
- Stores address details
- Auto-fills form on success

## Address Component Mapping

### Google Places API ‚Üí Form Fields
```javascript
// Google Places address_components mapping:
street_number ‚Üí houseNo
route ‚Üí streetAddress
sublocality_level_1/sublocality ‚Üí area
locality ‚Üí city
administrative_area_level_1 ‚Üí state
postal_code ‚Üí pincode
```

### OpenStreetMap Nominatim ‚Üí Form Fields
```javascript
// Nominatim address mapping:
house_number ‚Üí houseNo
road/street ‚Üí streetAddress
suburb/neighbourhood/quarter ‚Üí area
city/town/village ‚Üí city
state ‚Üí state (matched from dropdown)
postcode ‚Üí pincode
```

## User Interface Changes

### Helper Text Update
**Before:**
```html
<p class="form-helper-text">
    Please fill in all required fields for accurate delivery
</p>
```

**After:**
```html
<p class="form-helper-text">
    <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 
    Fields will be auto-filled when you use "Current Location" or search. 
    You can modify any details as needed.
</p>
```

### Visual Indicators
1. **Green Highlight** - Shows which fields were auto-filled
2. **Info Icon** - Indicates editable auto-fill feature
3. **Success Notification** - Confirms auto-fill completion
4. **Smooth Animations** - All transitions use ease timing

## User Flow Examples

2. Browser requests location permission
3. GPS coordinates obtained: 12.9352¬∞N, 77.6245¬∞E
4. Google Maps/Nominatim reverse geocodes the coordinates
5. Address detected: "123, MG Road, Koramangala, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560001"
6. Manual form automatically expands
7. All fields fill with parsed data:
   - House No: "123"
   - Street: "MG Road"
   - Area: "Koramangala"
   - City: "Bangalore"

10. Page scrolls to form
11. **Customer can now edit any field if needed**

### Example 2: Using Search
1. Customer types "Koramangala, Bangalore" in search box
2. Google autocomplete shows suggestions
3. Customer selects "Koramangala, Bengaluru, Karnataka"
4. Address components extracted from Google Places
5. Manual form auto-expands and fills
6. Fields populated with available data
7. Customer edits "House No" to add their building number
8. Customer adds landmark "Near Sony World Signal"

### Example 3: Editing Auto-Filled Data

2. Customer notices house number is wrong
3. Clicks on "House No" field
4. Changes "12" to "12A"
5. All other fields remain as auto-filled

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Incomplete Address Data
If some components are missing:

### 2. No House Number

- Customer must enter manually
- Validation still requires house number

### 3. State Not in Dropdown
- Defaults to "Karnataka"
- Customer can change if needed
- Matches similar state names (e.g., "Karnataka" matches "KA")

### 4. Invalid Pincode Format
- Auto-filled if available
- Triggers pincode lookup API
- Customer can modify
- Validation ensures 6 digits

### 5. Form Already Filled
- Auto-fill overwrites existing data
- Green highlight shows new data
- Customer can revert changes manually

### 6. Location Permission Denied
- Falls back to manual entry only
- No auto-fill occurs
- Customer enters all data manually
- Still shows helper text about auto-fill feature
